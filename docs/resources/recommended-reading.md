    *   **Publisher:** American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)
    *   **Description:** Focuses on research related to gravity biology and space physiology, including the effects of altered gravity on biological systems.
    *   **Why it's Recommended:** Important for those with a strong interest in the fundamental physiological responses to spaceflight.

*   **Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine**
    *   **Publisher:** Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA)
    *   **Description:** An older title for AMHP, but past issues contain valuable historical research and foundational papers.
    *   **Why it's Recommended:** For historical context and to explore the evolution of research in the field.

## Influential Papers and Reports

Certain papers and reports have significantly shaped the understanding and practice of aerospace medicine. While too numerous to list exhaustively, here are examples of types of documents to seek out:

*   **NASA Technical Reports:** NASA publishes extensive technical reports on human research in space, mission medical operations, and spaceflight-induced physiological changes. These are often available through the NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS).
    *   **Example Search Terms:** "Human Adaptation to Spaceflight," "Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) reports," "Radiation exposure in space."

*   **FAA Medical Handbooks and Advisory Circulars:** The FAA publishes detailed guidance for Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs) and pilots regarding medical certification standards and common aeromedical issues.
    *   **Example:** FAA Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners.

*   **Military Medical Publications:** Each military branch publishes medical guidelines, research findings, and operational reports relevant to their specific aviation and space medicine practices.

*   **Key Review Articles:** Look for comprehensive review articles in AMHP or other relevant journals that summarize the current state of knowledge on specific topics (e.g., bone loss in space, psychological effects of isolation).

*   **Historical Documents:** Explore seminal papers from pioneers in aerospace medicine (e.g., early research on high-altitude physiology, G-force tolerance, or the selection of the Mercury Seven astronauts).

By delving into these recommended readings, you will gain a robust understanding of aerospace medicine's past, present, and future, preparing you for a successful career in this dynamic field.
