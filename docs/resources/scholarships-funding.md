# Scholarships & Funding

Financial support is often a critical component for medical students pursuing specialized interests, and aerospace medicine is no exception. Numerous scholarships, grants, and funding opportunities exist to help aspiring aerospace medical professionals offset educational costs, support research endeavors, and facilitate attendance at important scientific meetings. This section highlights key sources of funding and provides guidance on how to find and apply for them.

## Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) Foundation Scholarships

The AsMA Foundation is a primary source of financial support for students and residents in aerospace medicine. They offer a variety of scholarships designed to encourage and support the next generation of leaders in the field. These scholarships typically aim to assist with educational expenses, research projects, or travel to the Annual Scientific Meeting.

### Featured Scholarships:

*   **Stanley R. Mohler, M.D., Aerospace Medicine Endowed Scholarship:** This scholarship provides training grants and awards to help students and residents fund their studies or research activities. It is open to full-time students and residents from any country, with priority given to those early in their careers and members of AsMA and AMSRO. *Application Deadline: January 31 annually.*

*   **AsMA Fellows Scholarship:** Managed by the AsMA Fellows Group, this scholarship helps cover costs such as registration fees, transportation, and meal per diem for eligible students or residents attending academic conferences related to aerospace medicine. Award amounts are typically $2,000 for first place and $1,000 for second place. Applicants must be current AsMA members and enrolled in an accredited undergraduate, graduate, or postgraduate education/training program in aerospace medicine or an allied scientific discipline.

*   **AMSRO Trailblazer Scholarship (formerly AMSRO Diversity Scholarship):** This scholarship aims to engage medical students and premeds in aerospace medicine, with special consideration for non-members new to AsMA and AMSRO. Awardees receive $1,000 for an approved aerospace medicine event, waived one-year student membership fees for AsMA and AMSRO, waived student registration for the AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting, and tailored pre-professional mentorship. *Application Deadline: March 1 annually.*

*   **Berry Memorial Scholarship:** This scholarship offers $500 to U.S.-based students with an interest in aerospace medicine who are in good academic standing and enrolled full-time in medical or graduate school. Applicants must be U.S. citizens. *Application Deadline: March 1 annually.*

*   **Anita Mantri, Ph.D., Memorial Travel Scholarship:** This scholarship provides a $1,000 travel stipend for students and residents to attend an aerospace medicine meeting of their choice. *Application Deadline: January 31 annually.*

## Other Known Grants and Funding Bodies

Beyond the AsMA Foundation, other organizations and programs may offer funding relevant to aerospace medicine, particularly for research or specialized training.

*   **Brooke Owens Fellowship:** While not exclusively for medical students, this highly competitive program offers paid internships and mentorship for undergraduate women and gender minorities interested in aerospace. While primarily engineering-focused, it can be a pathway for those with interdisciplinary interests.

*   **University-Specific Grants:** Many universities and medical schools offer internal grants, fellowships, or research stipends for their students. Check with your institution's financial aid office, research office, or specific departmental programs.

*   **National Institutes of Health (NIH):** For research projects with broader biomedical relevance, various NIH institutes may offer student research grants or training programs. Explore the NIH website for opportunities like the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) or individual research grants.

*   **Military Scholarship Programs:** As discussed in the Military Training Pathways section, programs like the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) and the Medical and Dental School Stipend Program (MDSSP) provide significant financial support for medical education in exchange for a service commitment.

*   **Aerospace Companies and Foundations:** Some private aerospace companies or their associated foundations may offer scholarships or internships that include financial support. Research individual company websites for such opportunities.

## Tips for Securing Funding

*   **Start Early:** Researching and applying for scholarships and grants is a time-consuming process. Begin well in advance of deadlines.
*   **Tailor Your Application:** Customize your essays and application materials to specifically address the criteria and mission of each funding body.
*   **Highlight Your Passion:** Clearly articulate your genuine interest in aerospace medicine and how the funding will help you achieve your goals.
*   **Demonstrate Merit:** Showcase your academic achievements, research experience, leadership roles, and any unique skills or experiences relevant to the field.
*   **Seek Feedback:** Have mentors, professors, or career advisors review your application materials before submission.

By actively seeking out and applying for these opportunities, medical students can significantly reduce the financial burden of their education and gain valuable support for their aerospace medicine aspirations.
