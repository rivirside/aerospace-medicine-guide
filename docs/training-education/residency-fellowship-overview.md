# Residency & Fellowship Overview

For medical graduates aspiring to specialize in aerospace medicine, the primary pathways involve dedicated residency and fellowship programs. These structured training experiences are designed to equip physicians with the specialized knowledge, clinical skills, and research acumen necessary to practice aerospace medicine effectively. Understanding the different types of programs and their typical structures is crucial for navigating this unique medical specialty.

## The Path to Board Certification

In the United States, aerospace medicine is a recognized medical specialty under the American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM). To become board-certified in aerospace medicine, physicians typically complete an ACGME-accredited residency program. These programs generally follow a similar structure, often incorporating a Master of Public Health (MPH) or equivalent degree.

## General Program Structure

Most aerospace medicine residency programs are two-year programs, often preceded by a clinical year (PGY-1) in a broad-based specialty such as internal medicine, family medicine, or emergency medicine. The two years of aerospace medicine residency typically include:

1.  **Academic Year:** This year is often dedicated to didactic learning, usually involving enrollment in a Master of Public Health (MPH) program with a concentration in aerospace medicine, public health, or occupational health. This provides a strong foundation in epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, and public health principles relevant to aerospace medicine.
2.  **Clinical/Practicum Year:** This year focuses on practical experience and clinical rotations. Rotations may include:
    *   **Aviation Medicine Clinics:** Gaining experience in conducting flight physicals, managing aeromedical waivers, and providing clinical care to aviators.
    *   **Space Medicine:** Rotations at institutions like NASA, focusing on astronaut health, space physiology, and mission support.
    *   **Occupational Medicine:** Understanding workplace health and safety, which is highly relevant to aviation and space environments.
    *   **Environmental Health:** Exposure to principles of toxicology, radiation safety, and environmental risk assessment.
    *   **Research:** Engaging in research projects related to aerospace medicine, often culminating in a thesis or publication.
    *   **Operational Experiences:** Depending on the program, this may include exposure to military flight operations, aeromedical evacuation, or commercial aviation medical departments.

## Different Pathways to Training

While the general structure is similar, the specific pathways to aerospace medicine training can vary, primarily categorized into military and civilian programs. Some physicians may also pursue fellowships after completing their aerospace medicine residency to gain further specialization.

### Military Training Pathways

These programs are offered by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army. They are designed to train flight surgeons who will serve the unique medical needs of military aviators and space personnel. Military programs often integrate operational experiences directly into the curriculum and may have different entry requirements, such as prior military service or participation in scholarship programs like HPSP.

### Civilian Training Pathways

Civilian programs are typically university-based and prepare physicians for roles in government agencies (e.g., FAA, NASA), commercial aerospace companies, academic institutions, and private practice. These programs often have a strong emphasis on public health, research, and clinical aerospace medicine, with opportunities for rotations at various civilian aerospace organizations.

### Fellowships

After completing an aerospace medicine residency, some physicians may pursue additional fellowships to specialize further in areas such as:

*   **Space Medicine:** Focusing exclusively on the medical challenges of human spaceflight.
*   **Hyperbaric Medicine:** Gaining expertise in the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which has applications in dive medicine and certain aerospace-related conditions.
*   **Research Fellowships:** Dedicated time for advanced research in a specific area of aerospace medicine.

## Flowchart of Pathways

To visualize the different routes, consider the following simplified flowcharts:

**Pathway 1: Traditional Civilian Route**

Medical School (MD/DO) -> Clinical Internship (PGY-1) -> Aerospace Medicine Residency (2 years, often with MPH) -> Board Certification -> Practice

**Pathway 2: Military Route (e.g., HPSP)**

Medical School (MD/DO, with HPSP) -> Military Internship (PGY-1) -> Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) Course (for flight surgeon duty) -> Operational Flight Surgeon Duty -> (Optional) Aerospace Medicine Residency -> Board Certification -> Continued Military Service or Transition to Civilian Practice

**Pathway 3: Post-Residency Fellowship**

Medical School (MD/DO) -> Primary Residency (e.g., EM, IM, FM) -> Aerospace Medicine Residency -> (Optional) Fellowship (e.g., Space Medicine, Hyperbaric Medicine) -> Practice
