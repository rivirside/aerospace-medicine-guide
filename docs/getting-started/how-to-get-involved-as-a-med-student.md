# How to Get Involved as a Med Student

For medical students eager to explore and engage with aerospace medicine, there are numerous avenues to gain experience, build a network, and deepen your understanding of the field. Early involvement can significantly enhance your application to residency programs and provide invaluable insights into this unique specialty.

## Finding a Mentor

One of the most impactful steps you can take is to find a mentor in aerospace medicine. A mentor can provide guidance, introduce you to opportunities, and share their experiences. Look for mentors through:

*   **Professional Organizations:** Attend conferences (like the Aerospace Medical Association Annual Scientific Meeting) and network with attendees. Many organizations have mentorship programs.
*   **Academic Institutions:** Reach out to faculty at universities with aerospace medicine programs (e.g., UTMB, Wright State) or those involved in space health research.
*   **Military Contacts:** If you have military connections, inquire about speaking with flight surgeons or medical officers.
*   **Alumni Networks:** Your medical school's alumni office might connect you with graduates in aerospace medicine.

When reaching out, be clear about your interests and what you hope to gain from the mentorship. A brief, polite email expressing your admiration for their work and your desire to learn more is a good starting point.

## Aerospace Medicine Clerkships & Electives

Direct exposure to the field through clerkships and electives is invaluable. These experiences allow you to see aerospace medicine in practice and understand the day-to-day responsibilities of professionals in the field.

*   **NASA Clerkship:** The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) often offers clerkships or rotations at its various centers, particularly at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. These opportunities provide unparalleled exposure to space medicine, astronaut health, and human research in space.
*   **University-Based Electives:** Many universities with aerospace medicine residency programs offer elective rotations for medical students. These can provide clinical experience in aviation medicine clinics, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and exposure to research projects.
*   **Military Electives:** If you are part of an HPSP program or considering military service, inquire about electives at military medical centers or flight surgeon training units.
*   **UTMB Courses:** The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, a leader in aerospace medicine, offers various courses and opportunities for medical students to engage with the field.

## Joining Student Organizations

Becoming an active member of student organizations focused on aerospace medicine is an excellent way to connect with peers, learn about the field, and participate in relevant activities.

*   **Aerospace Medical Student & Resident Organization (AMSRO):** AMSRO is the student and resident section of the Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA). It is a must-mention for any medical student interested in aerospace medicine. AMSRO provides a platform for networking, mentorship, research opportunities, and educational events. They often host webinars, workshops, and social events at the AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting.
*   **Local Interest Groups:** Some medical schools may have their own aerospace medicine interest groups or clubs. If not, consider starting one!

## Attending Conferences

Conferences are vital for networking, learning about the latest research, and understanding the current landscape of aerospace medicine.

*   **Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) Annual Scientific Meeting:** This is the premier conference for aerospace medicine professionals globally. Attending this meeting allows you to hear from leading experts, present research, and connect with potential mentors and future colleagues. AMSRO activities are often integrated into the AsMA meeting.
*   **Other Relevant Conferences:** Depending on your specific interests, consider conferences related to space exploration (e.g., Humans in Space Symposium), aviation safety, or specific medical specialties that intersect with aerospace medicine.

By actively pursuing these opportunities, medical students can build a strong foundation in aerospace medicine, demonstrate their commitment to the field, and prepare themselves for a rewarding career in this exciting specialty.
